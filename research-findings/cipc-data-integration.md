# CIPC Data Access and Integration Research Findings

## Executive Summary

CIPC provides **multiple pathways for accessing South African company registry data**, but **legal compliance and commercial usage permissions require careful consideration**. The most viable approaches are:

1. **CIPC API Services**: Official RESTful API with proper commercial licensing
2. **CSV Downloads**: Monthly alphabetical files available but with commercial use restrictions
3. **Individual Disclosures**: Per-company data access at R30 per company

**UPDATED RECOMMENDATION** (Based on confirmed legal permissions): **Use CSV download approach as primary method**, as we have full legal permissions to use the data commercially. This provides superior cost efficiency, simplicity, and reliability compared to API integration.

**Critical Update**: **Full legal permissions confirmed** for commercial usage of CIPC data - this enables the optimal CSV-based approach.
