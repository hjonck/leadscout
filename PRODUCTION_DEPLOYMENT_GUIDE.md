## 📝 Usage Instructions

### **Basic Lead Enrichment**
```bash
# Process Excel file with lead data
poetry run leadscout enrich input_leads.xlsx --output enriched_leads.xlsx

# With batch processing for large files
poetry run leadscout enrich large_file.xlsx --batch-size 100 --output results.xlsx

# With progress monitoring
poetry run leadscout enrich leads.xlsx --verbose --progress
```

### **Input File Format**
Required columns in Excel file:
- `EntityName` - Company name
- `DirectorName` - Director/contact name for classification
- `ContactNumber` - Phone number
- `EmailAddress` - Email address

Optional columns:
- `RegisteredAddressProvince` - Province for enhanced matching
- `TradingAsName` - Alternative company name

### **Output Format**
Enhanced Excel file includes original data plus:
- `DirectorEthnicity` - Classified ethnicity (african, indian, coloured, white, mixed)
- `DirectorConfidence` - Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- `ClassificationMethod` - Method used (rule_based, phonetic, llm)
- `ProcessingTimeMs` - Time taken for classification
- `EnrichmentTimestamp` - When processing occurred

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### **Cache Configuration**
```python
# Default cache settings (optimized for performance)
CACHE_DIR = "./cache"                    # Cache directory
CACHE_TTL_HOURS = 24                     # 24-hour cache lifetime
CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES = 100000               # Maximum cached classifications
CACHE_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_HOURS = 12        # Automatic cleanup frequency
```

### **Performance Tuning**
```python
# Batch processing settings
BATCH_SIZE = 100                         # Records per batch (adjustable)
CONCURRENT_WORKERS = 5                   # Concurrent processing (adjust for CPU)
MEMORY_LIMIT_MB = 500                    # Memory usage limit

# Classification settings
RULE_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.8          # Rule-based minimum confidence
PHONETIC_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.6      # Phonetic minimum confidence
ENABLE_LLM_FALLBACK = False              # LLM for unknown names (optional)
```

## 🚨 Error Handling & Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Classification Performance Issues**
```bash
# Symptom: Slow classification
# Solution: Check cache status and clear if needed
poetry run leadscout cache clean
poetry run leadscout cache status

# Verify performance
poetry run leadscout benchmark
```

#### **Memory Usage Issues**
```bash
# Symptom: High memory usage
# Solution: Reduce batch size and enable cleanup
poetry run leadscout enrich file.xlsx --batch-size 50
```

#### **Unknown Names**
```bash
# Symptom: Many names returning "unknown" 
# Status: Expected behavior - system optimized for SA names
# Solution: Enable LLM fallback if needed (adds cost)
export CLAUDE_API_KEY="your-key"
poetry run leadscout config set llm_enabled true
```

### **Log Analysis**
```bash
# Check system logs
tail -f logs/leadscout.log

# Error analysis
grep "ERROR" logs/leadscout.log | tail -20

# Performance analysis
grep "Performance" logs/leadscout.log | tail -10
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### **Data Protection**
- **No data persistence**: Classifications cached temporarily only
- **Local processing**: All processing happens locally, no data sent to external services
- **Optional LLM**: External API calls only if LLM enabled (currently 0% usage)
- **Secure caching**: Cache data encrypted at rest (configurable)

### **API Key Security**
```bash
# Store API keys securely (only if LLM needed)
export CLAUDE_API_KEY="your-key"          # Environment variable
# OR
poetry run leadscout config set claude_api_key "your-key"  # Encrypted storage
```

### **Access Control**
- **File permissions**: Ensure proper read/write permissions on input/output files
- **Cache directory**: Secure cache directory with appropriate permissions
- **Log files**: Protect log files containing processing information

## 📈 Production Monitoring

### **Key Metrics to Monitor**
1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Classification speed (target: <10ms)
   - Cache hit rate (target: >80%)
   - Memory usage (target: <500MB)
   - Processing throughput (target: >100 leads/minute)

2. **Quality Metrics**
   - Classification confidence distribution
   - Method usage (rule_based vs phonetic vs llm)
   - Error rates and edge cases
   - User satisfaction with results

3. **Cost Metrics**
   - LLM API usage (target: <5%)
   - Total processing cost per lead

  Classification Speed: >50ms (5x slower than target)
  Memory Usage: >1GB (2x target)
  Error Rate: >5%
  
Quality Alerts:
  Low Confidence Rate: >20%
