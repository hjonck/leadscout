# Test API connectivity
poetry run python -c "
import os
import openai
openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
print('✅ OpenAI API key validated')
"
```

## Configuration Management

### 1. API Key Security

**Development Environment:**
```bash
# Use .env file (NOT committed to git)
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." >> .env
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-..." >> .env
```

**Production Environment:**
```bash
# Use system environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Or use secure vault/secrets management
# AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.
```

### 2. Performance Configuration

**Batch Size Optimization:**
- **Small datasets** (< 1,000 leads): 50-100 batch size
- **Medium datasets** (1,000-10,000 leads): 100-200 batch size  
- **Large datasets** (> 10,000 leads): 200-500 batch size

**Rate Limit Configuration:**
```python
# Adjust in configuration based on API tier
OPENAI_RATE_LIMIT = 60  # requests per minute
ANTHROPIC_RATE_LIMIT = 60  # requests per minute
```

### 3. Logging Configuration

**Production Logging Setup:**
```bash
# Create log directory
mkdir -p logs

# Configure log rotation
echo "LOG_DIR=./logs" >> .env
echo "LOG_ROTATION=daily" >> .env
echo "LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=30" >> .env
```

## Operational Procedures

### 1. Starting a Job

**Basic Job Execution:**
```bash
# Standard processing
poetry run leadscout jobs process input.xlsx --batch-size 100 --learning

# With custom output
poetry run leadscout jobs process input.xlsx --output enriched_leads.xlsx

# Force mode (clears stale locks)
poetry run leadscout jobs process input.xlsx --force
```

**Advanced Job Options:**
```bash
# Large dataset optimization
poetry run leadscout jobs process large_file.xlsx \
  --batch-size 200 \
  --learning \
  --output results.xlsx

# Resume disabled (fresh start)
poetry run leadscout jobs process input.xlsx --no-resume
```

### 2. Job Monitoring

**Real-time Monitoring:**
```bash
# Monitor job progress
tail -f logs/leadscout.log | grep "progress_percent"

# Check job status
poetry run leadscout jobs list

# Detailed job status
poetry run leadscout jobs status <job-id>
```

**Performance Monitoring:**
```bash
# Monitor LLM usage
tail -f logs/leadscout.log | grep "llm_calls\|cost_saved"

# Monitor learning efficiency
tail -f logs/leadscout.log | grep "patterns_per_llm_call"

# Monitor batch performance
tail -f logs/leadscout.log | grep "batch_time_seconds"
```

### 3. Job Management

**Handling Interruptions:**
```bash
# Resume after interruption
poetry run leadscout jobs process input.xlsx  # Auto-resumes

# Clear stale locks
poetry run leadscout jobs process input.xlsx --force

# Manual lock cleanup (if needed)
sqlite3 cache/jobs.db "DELETE FROM job_locks;"
```

**Job Cleanup:**
```bash
# List completed jobs
sqlite3 cache/jobs.db "SELECT job_id, status, processed_leads_count FROM job_executions WHERE status = 'completed';"

# Archive old jobs (manual)
sqlite3 cache/jobs.db "UPDATE job_executions SET status = 'archived' WHERE completion_time < date('now', '-30 days');"
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Learning Database Optimization

**Enhancement 1 Benefits:**
- **Immediate Pattern Availability**: 80% cost reduction within same job
- **Real-time Learning**: Patterns available for next lead in batch
- **Exponential Improvement**: Learning compounds with each classification

**Monitoring Learning Efficiency:**
```bash
# Check learning statistics
sqlite3 cache/llm_learning.db "
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_patterns,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ethnicity) as ethnicities_learned,
  AVG(confidence) as avg_confidence
FROM name_classifications;
"

# Monitor cost savings
poetry run python -c "
from src.leadscout.classification.learning_database import LLMLearningDatabase
db = LLMLearningDatabase()
stats = db.get_learning_statistics()
print(f'Learning Efficiency: {stats[\"learning_efficiency\"]:.2f} patterns per LLM call')
"
```

### 2. Batch Size Optimization

**Dynamic Batch Sizing:**
```bash
# Start with conservative batch size
poetry run leadscout jobs process input.xlsx --batch-size 50

# Monitor performance and increase
poetry run leadscout jobs process input.xlsx --batch-size 100

# Large datasets with proven performance
poetry run leadscout jobs process input.xlsx --batch-size 200
```

**Performance Monitoring:**
```bash
# Monitor batch processing time
tail -f logs/leadscout.log | grep "batch_time_seconds" | awk '{print $NF}'

# Calculate optimal batch size based on performance
# Target: 30-60 seconds per batch for optimal balance
```

### 3. Memory Optimization

**Streaming Processing Benefits:**
- **Constant Memory Usage**: O(batch_size) regardless of file size
- **Large File Support**: Process 100K+ leads without memory issues
- **Resume Capability**: Restart from any point without data loss

**Memory Monitoring:**
```bash
# Monitor memory usage during processing
watch "ps aux | grep leadscout | grep -v grep"

# Check cache database sizes
du -sh cache/*.db
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. API Key Security

**Security Checklist:**
- [ ] Store API keys in environment variables, never in code
- [ ] Use secure secrets management in production
- [ ] Rotate API keys regularly
- [ ] Monitor API usage for anomalies
- [ ] Set up billing alerts

**Environment Security:**
```bash
# Secure cache directory permissions
chmod 700 cache/
chmod 600 cache/*.db

# Secure log directory
chmod 700 logs/
chmod 640 logs/*.log
```

### 2. Data Security

**Lead Data Protection:**
- **No Persistent Storage**: Lead data not retained after processing
- **Encrypted Cache**: SQLite databases with appropriate permissions
- **Audit Trail**: Complete processing logs for compliance
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies

**Compliance Measures:**
```bash
# Check data retention
sqlite3 cache/jobs.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM job_executions WHERE completion_time < date('now', '-90 days');"

# Clean old data
sqlite3 cache/jobs.db "DELETE FROM lead_processing_results WHERE job_id IN (SELECT job_id FROM job_executions WHERE completion_time < date('now', '-90 days'));"
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### 1. Performance Metrics

**Key Performance Indicators:**
- **Processing Speed**: Target 100+ leads per minute
- **LLM Usage**: Target <5% after learning warmup
- **Success Rate**: Target >95% successful classifications
- **Learning Efficiency**: Target >1.5 patterns per LLM call

**Monitoring Commands:**
```bash
# Real-time performance dashboard
watch "
echo 'Recent Job Performance:'
sqlite3 cache/jobs.db \"SELECT 
  job_id, 
  processed_leads_count, 
  (processed_leads_count * 1.0 / (julianday('now') - julianday(start_time)) / 86400) as leads_per_minute,
  status 
FROM job_executions 
WHERE start_time > datetime('now', '-1 hour')
ORDER BY start_time DESC 
LIMIT 5;\"
"
```

### 2. Health Checks

**System Health Validation:**
```bash
# Create health check script
cat > health_check.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "LeadScout Health Check - $(date)"

# Check API keys
if [ -z "$OPENAI_API_KEY" ]; then
  echo "❌ OPENAI_API_KEY not set"
  exit 1
fi

# Check databases
if [ ! -f "cache/jobs.db" ]; then
  echo "❌ Job database not found"
  exit 1
fi

# Check system resources
FREE_SPACE=$(df . | tail -1 | awk '{print $4}')
if [ $FREE_SPACE -lt 1000000 ]; then  # Less than 1GB
  echo "⚠️  Low disk space: ${FREE_SPACE}KB"
fi

echo "✅ System healthy"
EOF

chmod +x health_check.sh
```

### 3. Alerting Setup

**Log-based Alerting:**
```bash
# Monitor for errors
tail -f logs/leadscout.log | grep -i "error\|failed" | while read line; do
  echo "ALERT: $line"
  # Send notification (email, Slack, etc.)
done

# Monitor for high LLM usage
tail -f logs/leadscout.log | grep "llm_usage_percentage" | awk -F: '{if($NF > 20) print "HIGH LLM USAGE: " $0}'
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### 1. Common Issues

**Lock Acquisition Errors:**
```bash
# Problem: "Cannot acquire lock - another job may be running"
# Solution: Use force flag to clear stale locks
poetry run leadscout jobs process input.xlsx --force
```

**Batch Size Issues:**
```bash
# Problem: Job fails to resume with different batch size
# Solution: System automatically handles batch size changes
# Uses processed_count instead of calculated position
```

**API Rate Limiting:**
```bash
# Problem: Rate limit errors during processing
# Solution: System automatically handles with exponential backoff
# Monitor rate limit usage in logs
tail -f logs/leadscout.log | grep "rate_limit"
```

**Memory Issues:**
```bash
# Problem: Out of memory with large files
# Solution: Reduce batch size
poetry run leadscout jobs process input.xlsx --batch-size 50
```

### 2. Performance Issues

**Slow Processing:**
```bash
# Diagnosis: Check learning efficiency
sqlite3 cache/llm_learning.db "
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as learned_patterns,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ethnicity) as ethnicities
FROM name_classifications;
"

# Solution: Ensure learning database is being used
poetry run leadscout jobs process input.xlsx --learning
```

**High LLM Usage:**
```bash
# Diagnosis: Check pattern coverage
sqlite3 cache/llm_learning.db "
SELECT ethnicity, COUNT(*) as pattern_count 
FROM name_classifications 
GROUP BY ethnicity;
"

# Solution: Allow more learning time or add more diverse training data
```

### 3. Database Issues

**Database Corruption:**
```bash
# Check database integrity
sqlite3 cache/jobs.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
sqlite3 cache/llm_learning.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"

# Backup before repair
cp cache/jobs.db cache/jobs.db.backup
cp cache/llm_learning.db cache/llm_learning.db.backup

# Repair if needed
sqlite3 cache/jobs.db ".dump" | sqlite3 cache/jobs_repaired.db
```

**Lock Issues:**
```bash
# Check for stale locks
sqlite3 cache/jobs.db "SELECT * FROM job_locks;"

# Clear all locks (safe when no jobs running)
sqlite3 cache/jobs.db "DELETE FROM job_locks;"

# Clear specific file lock
sqlite3 cache/jobs.db "DELETE FROM job_locks WHERE input_file_path = 'path/to/file.xlsx';"
```

## Backup and Recovery

### 1. Backup Procedures

**Critical Data to Backup:**
- Learning database: `cache/llm_learning.db`
- Job history: `cache/jobs.db`
- Configuration: `.env` file
- Logs: `logs/` directory

**Backup Script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
BACKUP_DIR="backups/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR

# Backup databases
cp cache/*.db $BACKUP_DIR/
cp .env $BACKUP_DIR/
tar -czf $BACKUP_DIR/logs.tar.gz logs/

echo "Backup completed: $BACKUP_DIR"
```

### 2. Recovery Procedures

**Database Recovery:**
```bash
# Restore from backup
cp backups/20250707_120000/llm_learning.db cache/
cp backups/20250707_120000/jobs.db cache/

# Verify integrity
sqlite3 cache/jobs.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
```

**Configuration Recovery:**
```bash
# Restore environment
cp backups/20250707_120000/.env .

# Verify configuration
poetry run python -c "from src.leadscout.core.config import get_settings; print('✅ Config valid')"
```
