## Integration Protocol with Developer A

### APIs You Must Consume
1. **Name Classification Cache**:
   ```python
   # Check cache before classifying
   cached_result = await cache_client.get_classification(name)
   
   # Store your classification results
   await cache_client.store_classification(name, classification)
   
   # Get similar names for few-shot examples
   similar_names = await cache_client.find_similar_names(name, limit=10)
   ```

2. **Company Search Integration**:
   ```python
   # Search CIPC data for company validation
   company_matches = await company_search.search_companies(
       company_name=lead.entity_name,
       province=lead.registered_address_province
   )
   ```

### Performance SLAs You Must Meet
- **Name Classification**: <100ms average (including cache check)
- **Rule-Based Classification**: <10ms for dictionary matches
- **Phonetic Matching**: <50ms for similar name search
- **LLM Classification**: <2s including few-shot retrieval
- **Full Enrichment**: <30s per lead average

## Critical Research Foundation

### South African Name Classification Insights
Based on the research document, your implementation must leverage:

1. **Multi-Layered Approach** (Rule → Phonetic → LLM):
   - **95% Coverage Target**: Rule-based classification using curated dictionaries
   - **85%+ Accuracy**: Phonetic matching for variant spellings
   - **95%+ Accuracy**: LLM with few-shot examples for edge cases

2. **South African Naming Patterns**:
   - **African**: Bongani → Nguni, distinct forename/surname pools
   - **Indian**: Pillay → Tamil, subcontinental patterns
   - **Cape Malay**: Cassiem → historical naming conventions
   - **Coloured**: Month-surnames (April, September, October) from slave naming
   - **Priority Logic**: Classify by least European element in multi-word names

3. **Cost Optimization Strategy**:
   - **Augmented Retrieval**: 40%+ cost reduction using few-shot examples
   - **Batch Processing**: 20-30 names per LLM request
   - **Cache Efficiency**: >80% hit rate target reduces LLM calls to <5%
