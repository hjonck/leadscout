# Developer B: LLM Provider Selection & Implementation Guidance

## Research-Validated Decisions

Excellent planning on your LLM integration approach! Based on our Research Specialist's comprehensive findings, we have **validated recommendations** for optimal implementation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Primary LLM Provider Decision

### **Claude 3.5 Haiku - PRIMARY PROVIDER**
**Research Validation**: Tested and confirmed as optimal for SA name classification

**Why Claude 3.5 Haiku:**
- **Cost Efficiency**: Most cost-effective for our use case
- **Accuracy**: Validated performance on South African names
- **Speed**: Fast response times suitable for real-time classification
- **Anthropic API**: Excellent reliability and developer experience

### **Implementation Priority Order:**
1. **Claude 3.5 Haiku** - Primary implementation (implement first)
2. **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** - Secondary fallback (implement if time allows)
3. **Provider abstraction** - Clean interface for easy provider switching

## ðŸ“Š Research-Backed Optimization Strategies

### **Cost Optimization (85-90% reduction achievable):**
```python
# From research findings - implement these patterns:

# 1. Optimized prompts (95 tokens - research validated)
CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """
Classify this South African name's ethnicity: "{name}"
Respond: african|indian|cape_malay|coloured|white|unknown
Consider SA cultural patterns: Nguni, Tamil, Cape Muslim, Afrikaans origins.
"""

# 2. Batch processing (research shows 20-30 names per request optimal)
async def classify_batch(names: List[str]) -> List[Classification]:
    # Implementation with batching optimization

# 3. Prompt caching (significant cost reduction)
# Use Anthropic's prompt caching for repeated context
```

### **Performance Targets (from research):**
- **Response Time**: <2s per classification (including few-shot retrieval)
- **Cost Target**: <$0.001 per classification (vs $0.01-0.05 external APIs)
- **Accuracy**: >95% on unknown SA names (research confirmed achievable)

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Guidance

### **1. LLM Module Structure (follow established patterns):**
```python
# src/leadscout/classification/llm.py
class LLMClassifier:
    """LLM-based name classification using Claude 3.5 Haiku."""
    
    async def classify(self, name: str) -> ClassificationResult:
        """Classify using LLM with cost optimization."""
        
    async def classify_batch(self, names: List[str]) -> List[ClassificationResult]:
        """Batch classification for cost efficiency."""
        
    def _build_few_shot_prompt(self, name: str) -> str:
        """Build optimized prompt with SA examples."""
```

### **2. Few-Shot Learning (leverage your SA dictionary):**
```python
# Use your 366+ curated SA names for few-shot examples
def get_few_shot_examples(self, target_name: str) -> List[str]:
    """Get 3-5 relevant SA names from dictionary for context."""
    # Select examples from similar phonetic or linguistic patterns
    # This provides context that dramatically improves accuracy
```

### **3. Cost Monitoring & Circuit Breakers:**
```python
# Implement cost tracking (research shows this is critical)
class CostMonitor:
    async def track_usage(self, tokens_used: int, cost: float):
        """Track LLM usage and implement circuit breakers."""
        
    async def should_allow_request(self) -> bool:
        """Prevent cost overruns with configurable limits."""
```

## ðŸ“š Research Documents to Reference

**Essential Reading for Implementation:**
1. **`research-findings/llm-cost-optimization.md`** - Claude API setup and optimization strategies
2. **`research-findings/research-summary-report.md`** - Strategic context and provider comparison
3. **`research-findings/supervisor-briefing-report.md`** - Executive summary of findings

**Key Research Findings:**
- Claude 3.5 Haiku **validated** as optimal provider
- **85-90% cost reduction** achievable through documented strategies
- **Batch processing** significantly more cost-effective than individual calls
- **Few-shot learning** with SA names dramatically improves accuracy

## ðŸŽ¯ Integration with Your Existing System

### **Multi-Layered Architecture (maintain your excellent foundation):**
```python
# Your orchestrating classifier should follow this pattern:
async def classify(self, name: str) -> ClassificationResult:
    # 1. Rule-based (your 98.6% accurate system)
    if rule_result := await self.rule_classifier.classify(name):
        return rule_result
    
    # 2. Phonetic (your 80% accurate variant system)  
    if phonetic_result := await self.phonetic_classifier.classify(name):
        return phonetic_result
    
    # 3. LLM fallback (for 1-2% of truly unknown names)
    return await self.llm_classifier.classify(name)
```

### **Cache Integration (leverage Developer A's infrastructure):**
- **Store LLM results** in Developer A's cache system
- **30-day TTL** for LLM classifications (expensive to regenerate)
- **Cache warming** with common SA name patterns

## âš¡ Implementation Steps (Recommended Order)

### **Phase 1: Core LLM Integration**
1. **Claude 3.5 Haiku client** with optimized prompts
2. **Basic classification** for single names
3. **Integration** with your existing rule/phonetic system
4. **Cost monitoring** and circuit breakers

### **Phase 2: Optimization**
1. **Batch processing** for multiple names
2. **Few-shot learning** with SA dictionary examples
3. **Prompt caching** implementation
4. **Performance tuning** and validation

### **Phase 3: Production Readiness**
1. **Comprehensive testing** with edge cases
2. **Error handling** and fallback strategies
3. **Monitoring and metrics** integration
4. **Documentation** and handoff preparation

## ðŸš€ Success Criteria

**Quality Gates for LLM Integration:**
- [ ] Claude 3.5 Haiku primary provider implemented
- [ ] Cost optimization strategies active (target: <$0.001/classification)
- [ ] Integration with rule/phonetic layers seamless
- [ ] Comprehensive testing with SA names validation dataset
- [ ] Cost monitoring and circuit breakers functional
- [ ] Performance targets met (<2s response time)

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights from Research

**Why This Approach Works:**
- **Cost Efficiency**: Only 1-2% of names need LLM (your 98.6% rule-based accuracy)
- **Quality**: Few-shot learning with SA examples ensures high accuracy
- **Reliability**: Multi-layered fallback prevents system failures
- **Scalability**: Batch processing and caching enable production scale

Your excellent foundational work (98.6% accurate rule-based system) means the LLM layer will have **minimal usage** and **maximum impact** - exactly the cost-optimized approach our research validated.
