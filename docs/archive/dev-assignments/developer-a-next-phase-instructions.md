You need to complete the **CIPC Database Integration & Company Search** functionality to deliver the full lead enrichment capability.

### **Critical Path Tasks**

1. **Complete CIPC Database Integration** (Priority 1)
2. **Implement Company Search Functionality** (Priority 2)  
3. **End-to-End Pipeline Integration** (Priority 3)
4. **Final Production Validation** (Priority 4)

## üìã Task 1: CIPC Database Integration

### Session Initialization
```bash
# Navigate to project and activate environment
cd /Users/hjonck/Development/gitprojects/AgileWorksZA/leadscout
source .venv/bin/activate

# Review your progress and current status
Read PROJECT_PLAN.md
Read dev-tasks/developer-a-integration-report.md
```

### Implementation Requirements

**Build on your existing CSV downloader** (`src/leadscout/cipc/downloaders/csv_downloader.py`) to add database import functionality:

#### **A) Database Import System**
Create `src/leadscout/cipc/importers/database_importer.py`:

```python
"""CIPC database import system for processed CSV data.

Handles batch importing of CIPC company data with optimized performance
for 100K+ records while maintaining data integrity.

Integration with existing cache infrastructure (Developer A specialty).
"""

class CIPCDatabaseImporter:
    """Import processed CIPC CSV data into database with batch optimization."""
    
    async def import_csv_data(
        self, 
        processed_df: pd.DataFrame,
        batch_size: int = 1000
    ) -> ImportResults:
        """Import processed CSV data with batch optimization.
        
        Target Performance:
        - 1000+ records per second import speed
        - Memory efficient batch processing
        - Duplicate handling with registration number deduplication
        - Progress tracking and error recovery
        """
        
    async def create_search_indexes(self) -> None:
        """Create optimized indexes for company search performance.
        
        Indexes needed:
        - Company name (full-text search)
        - Registration number (exact match)
        - Province (filtering)
        - Company status (filtering)
        - Combined name + province (search optimization)
        """
        
    async def validate_import_integrity(self) -> ValidationResults:
        """Validate imported data integrity and search performance."""
```

#### **B) Integration Points**
- **Use your existing cache schema** for consistency
- **Leverage your async patterns** from the CSV downloader
- **Maintain type safety** with Pydantic models
- **Include comprehensive error handling** like your integration work

### Expected Deliverables
1. **Database import functionality** working with your CSV downloader
2. **Performance indexes** optimized for search operations
3. **Data validation** ensuring import integrity
4. **Integration tests** confirming functionality

## üìã Task 2: Company Search Implementation

### Implementation Requirements

Create `src/leadscout/cipc/search/company_searcher.py`:

```python
"""Company search functionality using imported CIPC data.

Provides fuzzy matching and filtering capabilities for lead enrichment
with performance optimized for real-time usage.

Integration with cache layer for sub-100ms search performance.
"""

class CompanySearcher:
    """Search CIPC company database with fuzzy matching and filtering."""
    
    async def search_companies(
        self,
        company_name: str,
        province: Optional[str] = None,
        company_status: Optional[CompanyStatus] = None,
        max_results: int = 10
    ) -> List[CompanyMatch]:
        """Search for companies with fuzzy matching.
        
        Target Performance:
        - <100ms search response time
        - >80% accuracy for name variations
        - Relevance scoring for result ranking
        - Province and status filtering
        """
        
    async def get_exact_match(
        self,
        registration_number: str
    ) -> Optional[CIPCCompany]:
        """Get exact company match by registration number.
        
        Target: <10ms response time with cache optimization
        """
        
    def calculate_match_confidence(
        self,
        search_term: str,
        company_name: str
    ) -> float:
        """Calculate relevance confidence score (0.0-1.0)."""
```

### Search Algorithm Requirements
- **Fuzzy matching**: Handle typos and variations in company names
- **Phonetic similarity**: Integration opportunity with Developer B's phonetic algorithms
- **Province filtering**: Geographic relevance for lead targeting
- **Status filtering**: Active/inactive company filtering
- **Relevance scoring**: Rank results by match confidence

### Expected Deliverables
1. **Company search API** with fuzzy matching
2. **Performance optimization** meeting <100ms targets  
3. **Search result ranking** with confidence scores
4. **Integration tests** with realistic search scenarios

## üìã Task 3: End-to-End Pipeline Integration

### Integration Testing Requirements

Create comprehensive tests validating the complete CIPC pipeline:

```python
async def test_complete_cipc_pipeline():
    """Test complete CIPC data pipeline from download to search."""
    
    # 1. Test CSV download (your existing system)
    downloader = CIPCCSVDownloader()
    files = await downloader.download_latest_files()
    
    # 2. Test database import (your new system)
    importer = CIPCDatabaseImporter()
    results = await importer.import_csv_data(processed_data)
    
    # 3. Test company search (your new system)  
    searcher = CompanySearcher()
    matches = await searcher.search_companies("Mthembu Holdings", province="KwaZulu-Natal")
    
    # 4. Validate integration with Developer B's classification
    # (This should work seamlessly with your existing cache integration)
```

### Performance Validation
- **Download performance**: Confirm CSV download working optimally
- **Import performance**: Target 1000+ records/second
- **Search performance**: Target <100ms response time
- **Memory efficiency**: No memory leaks during large imports

## üìã Task 4: Final Production Validation

### Create Final Validation Report

Document your complete CIPC system in `dev-tasks/developer-a-cipc-completion-report.md`:

```markdown
