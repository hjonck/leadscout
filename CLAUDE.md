# LeadScout - Claude Development Context

## Project Overview

LeadScout is a production-ready AI-powered lead enrichment system for South African businesses. The system processes Excel files containing business lead data and enriches them with multi-source research including CIPC registry data, website discovery, LinkedIn research, and AI-powered ethnicity classification for demographic targeting.

**Current Status**: Production-ready with complete CLI implementation and 68.6% cost efficiency through intelligent learning.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3.11+ with Poetry dependency management
- **Database**: SQLite for caching, job persistence, and learning data
- **CLI Framework**: Click with Poetry integration (`poetry run leadscout`)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for Excel manipulation, async httpx for API calls
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI/Anthropic for LLM classification fallback

### System Components
1. **Multi-layered Classification Pipeline**: Rule-based → Phonetic → LLM → Learning Database
2. **Resumable Job Framework**: SQLite-based job persistence with bulletproof resume capability
3. **Immediate Learning System**: Real-time pattern extraction reducing LLM costs by 80%+
4. **Pluggable Scoring Engine**: Modular scoring with configurable weights
5. **CIPC Integration**: South African company registry data processing

## Name Classification System

### Multi-Layered Classification Approach
1. **Rule-based Classification**: South African linguistic patterns (Afrikaans, Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho)
2. **Phonetic Matching**: Soundex, Metaphone, Double Metaphone, NYSIIS, Jaro-Winkler
3. **LLM Fallback**: OpenAI/Anthropic for unknown names with 100% confidence
4. **Learning Database**: Immediate pattern storage for exponential cost reduction
5. **Cache System**: Previously classified names with confidence scores

### Performance Achievements
- **Processing Speed**: 0.8ms average (625x faster than 500ms target)
- **Cost Efficiency**: 68.6% non-LLM classifications in production
- **Learning Effectiveness**: 2.000 patterns generated per LLM call
- **Memory Usage**: Constant O(batch_size) regardless of dataset size

## Development Environment Context

### Environment Setup
- **Claude Code Access**: Via `bunx @anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest` (always latest version)
- **Python Environment**: Homebrew Python 3.12 with `.venv` project environments
- **Node.js**: Automatic activation via `node_on` function when needed for MCP servers
- **Shell Support**: Fish, Zsh, and Bash all configured identically

**Reference**: See dotfiles documentation for detailed environment setup procedures.

### MCP Integration
- **Available Tools**: brave-search, context7, github, moneyworks
- **MoneyWorks Integration**: Local MCP server for project-specific data access
- **Management**: Use `claude mcp list/add/remove` commands
- **Installation**: Automated via `~/dotfiles/claude/install-mcp.sh`

**Key MCP Tools for Development**:
- **context7**: Dynamic documentation access for libraries
- **github**: Repository integration for issue/PR management  
- **brave-search**: Web research for development questions
- **moneyworks**: Project-specific business data access (44 tools available)

### API Integration Context

**Credential Management**:
- **Storage**: Environment variables via shell private configuration files
- **Required Keys**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (optional), `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- **Security**: SecretStr in Pydantic settings, never hardcoded

**Rate Limiting Strategy**:
- **OpenAI**: 3 RPM (free tier) to 60+ RPM (paid tier)
- **Anthropic**: 5 RPM standard with exponential backoff
- **Auto-switching**: Providers switch on rate limit failures
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures

## Database Architecture

### Job Management (jobs.db)
```sql
job_executions: job_id, input_file_path, batch_size, status, processed_leads_count
lead_processing_results: job_id, row_index, classification_result, processing_time_ms, api_cost
job_locks: input_file_path, job_id, locked_at (prevents concurrent processing)
```

### Learning Database (llm_learning.db)
```sql
name_classifications: name, ethnicity, confidence, created_at, source_type
-- Immediate pattern availability for cost optimization
```

## Development Workflow Context

### Multi-Claude Development Framework
- **Technical Project Lead**: Coordinates developers and validates work
- **Developer A**: CIPC integration, job framework, CLI implementation (COMPLETE)
- **Developer B**: Classification algorithms, learning system (COMPLETE)
- **Communication**: Via structured markdown files in `dev-tasks/`

### Critical Development Rules
1. **NEVER use `importlib.reload()`** - breaks Pydantic enum validation
2. **ALWAYS verify with test execution** - never assume functionality works
3. **Resumable job requirement** - all processing must support interruption/resume
4. **SQLite-first approach** - persistent storage for all operations
5. **Async patterns required** - all I/O operations must be async

**Reference**: See `CLAUDE_RULES.md` for complete development standards.

- **Geographic Data**: Provincial lead distribution and city classifications
- **Business Context**: Industry classification specific to SA market
- **Compliance**: POPIA compliance for personal data protection

## Critical Technical Decisions

### Why SQLite Over PostgreSQL
- **Development Simplicity**: File-based database for easy deployment
- **Performance**: Sufficient for lead processing workloads
- **Backup/Recovery**: Simple file-based backup procedures
- **Threading**: Appropriate locking for concurrent access patterns

### Why Immediate Learning (Enhancement 1)
- **Cost Impact**: 80% reduction in LLM costs within same job
- **Real-time Availability**: Patterns available for next lead in batch
- **Exponential Improvement**: Learning compounds with each classification
- **Zero Configuration**: Automatic pattern extraction from LLM successes

### Why Resumable Jobs Framework
- **Production Reliability**: Zero data loss on interruptions
- **Conservative Resume**: Always resume from last committed batch
- **Large Dataset Support**: Process 100K+ leads with constant memory usage
- **Batch Optimization**: Configurable batch sizes for performance tuning
