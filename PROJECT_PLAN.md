- [ ] Results improve lead prioritization
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable

## Decision Log

### 2025-01-05: Scope Decisions
- **CIPC/CIPRO Integration**: Deferred to post-MVP
- **Reasoning**: Complex integration, focus on proven data sources first
- **Impact**: Adjusted scoring weights to prioritize name classification

### 2025-01-05: Time Estimation Policy
- **Decision**: No time estimates for development tasks
- **Reasoning**: Estimates create false expectations and pressure
- **Alternative**: Focus on priority order and completion criteria

### 2025-01-05: Project Tracking
- **Tool**: PROJECT_PLAN.md (this document)
- **Update Frequency**: Every significant development session
- **Format**: Structured markdown with completion tracking

### 2025-01-05: Multi-Claude Development Framework
- **Strategy**: Specialized developer roles with Technical Project Lead coordination
- **Roles**: Developer A (CIPC & Caching), Developer B (Classification & Enrichment)
- **Communication**: Structured markdown files in dev-tasks/ directory
- **Quality Gates**: Technical Project Lead validates all work before integration
- **Benefits**: Parallel development, specialized expertise, reduced complexity per session
