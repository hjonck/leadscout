## High Priority Research Areas (Start Here)

### 1. Name Ethnicity Classification Services Evaluation
**Research Question**: Which external services provide the best accuracy for South African names?

**Your Mission**: Test and compare name classification services to determine if we should use external APIs or build our own system.

**Services to Test**:
1. **NamSor.com** ([namsor.com](https://namsor.com/))
2. **NamePrism** ([name-prism.com](http://name-prism.com/))
3. **Forebears.io** ([forebears.io](https://forebears.io/))

**Testing Protocol**:
```bash
# Create test dataset
Create test_names_sa.csv with 100 known SA names:
- 20 African names (Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, Tswana patterns)
- 20 Indian names (Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati patterns)  
- 20 Cape Malay names (historical patterns)
- 20 Coloured names (including month-surnames)
- 20 White names (Afrikaans, English patterns)

# Test each service
For each service:
1. Sign up for API access (free tier or trial)
2. Test API with your dataset
3. Record accuracy, response time, rate limits
4. Calculate cost per classification
5. Assess integration complexity
```

**Expected Deliverable**: `research-findings/name-classification-services.md`

### 2. CIPC Data Access Research  
**Research Question**: What's the most reliable way to access and process CIPC company data?

**Your Mission**: Validate CIPC data sources and determine optimal integration strategy.

**Investigation Tasks**:
```bash
# Test official CIPC downloads
1. Verify current CSV URLs work:
   wget https://www.cipc.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/List-1.csv
   wget https://www.cipc.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/List-14.csv
   (Test 5-6 different letters)

2. Analyze data quality:
   - Check file formats and consistency
   - Verify data completeness
   - Test company name patterns
   - Estimate total dataset size

3. Test alternative sources:
   - OpenOwnership.org SA data
   - Kaggle CIPC datasets
   - Open-Africa datasets

4. Legal compliance check:
   - Review CIPC terms of use
   - Verify commercial usage permissions
   - Check data update frequencies
```

**Expected Deliverable**: `research-findings/cipc-data-integration.md`

### 3. LLM Cost Optimization Research
**Research Question**: How can we minimize LLM costs while maximizing classification accuracy?

**Your Mission**: Test different LLM providers and optimization strategies to find the most cost-effective approach.

**Testing Protocol**:
```bash
# Provider comparison
Test with same 50 SA names:
1. OpenAI GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5-turbo
2. Claude-3 Sonnet vs Haiku  
3. Google Gemini Pro (if available)

# Cost optimization tests
1. Few-shot learning: Test 5, 10, 15, 20 examples
2. Batch processing: Test batch sizes 1, 10, 20, 30
3. Prompt engineering: Test different prompt formats
4. Function calling vs text completion cost comparison

# Accuracy measurement
For each test:
- Record classification accuracy
- Measure response time
- Calculate cost per classification
- Assess confidence scores
```

**Expected Deliverable**: `research-findings/llm-cost-optimization.md`

## Research Methodology Standards

### 1. Hands-On Testing Requirements
- **Always test with real APIs**: Never rely on documentation alone
- **Use realistic data**: South African names and business contexts
- **Record actual performance**: Response times, accuracy, costs
- **Test error scenarios**: Rate limits, malformed data, network issues
- **Document integration steps**: Actual code examples and setup procedures

### 2. Cost Analysis Standards
```bash
# Required cost calculations
For each service:
1. Free tier limits and restrictions
2. Paid tier pricing structure (per call, monthly, annual)
3. Rate limits and quotas
4. Realistic usage projections:
   - 1,000 classifications/month (small usage)
   - 10,000 classifications/month (medium usage)  
   - 100,000 classifications/month (high usage)
5. Hidden costs: setup fees, minimum commitments, overage charges
```

### 3. Documentation Template
