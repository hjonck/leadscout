## 📋 **REMAINING BACKLOG TASKS** (Post-CLI Completion)

### **🚨 Priority 1: Structured Logging Implementation**
**Task ID**: PROD-001  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Effort**: MODERATE  

**Requirements:**
1. **Create Centralized Logging Configuration**
   - File: `src/leadscout/core/logging.py`
   - Implement `setup_logging()` function with environment-based configuration
   - Support both JSON (production) and console (development) output

2. **Replace Basic Logging Patterns**
   - Update all modules from `logging.getLogger(__name__)` to `structlog.get_logger(__name__)`
   - Add structured context to all log messages
   - Include operation metadata (processing_time_ms, success/failure, etc.)

3. **Environment-Specific Configuration**
   - Add logging fields to Settings class: `log_level`, `log_format`, `enable_debug_logging`, `log_file_path`
   - Support production vs development logging modes
   - JSON logging for production, readable console for development

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All logging uses structured format with context
- [ ] Environment-based logging configuration working
- [ ] Clean separation between debug and production output
- [ ] Log files properly rotated and organized
